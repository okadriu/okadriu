I am a student living in Switzerland. I am learning how to program. I love to create and design websites with HTML5 and CSS3 (and a bit of JavaScript). It's fun to code something that everyone can easily see on the internet. I also have basic knowledge of Java, but there is still a lot to learn.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bootstrap5, jQuery, JSF, and Figma.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a website that displays the current weather.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to play videogames and code in my free time.
